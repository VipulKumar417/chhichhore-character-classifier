INT./EXT. HOSTEL 4 (1992) - LATE NIGHT

We open with the main entrance shot of hostel 4.

Followed by shots of a hostel wing, hostel corridor.

It’s very quiet.

A shadow is seen tiptoeing on the first floor of a wing.

It’s a teenage guy wearing just his undies and carrying a
bucket.

He knocks on one of the doors.

The door opens.

It’s Aniruddh aka Anni behind the door.

He looks at the visitor.

It’s Sexa.

Anni looks at him from top to bottom and smiles.

                       ANNI
             Itni raat ko pyaasi jawani bann ke
             kahaan ghhoom raha hai be?

                       SEXA
             Isiliye aaya hoon tere paas, bujhaa
             de meri pyaas.

Sexa shows him an empty bucket.

                       ANNI
             Dunk fight?

                       SEXA
             Bahut din ho gaye yaar.

Anni smiles.

                       ANNI
             Wohi main soch raha tha ki poori
             raat quantum physics chaat te hue
             kaise kategi.

Both smile at their plan.


INT. HOSTEL 4 - WING BATHROOM (1992) - LATE NIGHT

Shot of a bucket getting filled with water in the hostel
bathroom.
                                                           2.


                    ANNI
          Is bauchhar ka pehla shikaar kaun
          hoga?

Sexa is checking his reflection in the mirror.

                     SEXA
          Pehla shikaar woh jo bheegne pe
          heroin ki tarah ghutne na tek de,
          balki hero ki tarah teri ma behen
          ek kar de.

                    ANNI
          Mil gaya shikaar.

                     SEXA
          Kitthe?

                     ANNI
          Itthe.

Before Sexa can react Anni dunks him with water from his
bucket, laughs and runs out.

Sexa picks up his bucket and runs behind him.

                    SEXA
          Gaddaaaaarrrrr...


INT/EXT. HOSTEL 4 (VARIUOS PLACES) - LATE NIGHT

                    SEXA
          Toone saanp ki poonch pe nahi, main
          point pe pair rakha hai.

Sexa corners Anni in the corridor and dunks him back.

Lights of a few rooms switch on.

Few heads peep out and someone screams.

                    DARD KUMAR
          Kya chal raha hai be?

                    ANNI & SEXA
          Dunk fiiiiggggghhhhhhttttt!!!

                     DARD KUMAR
          Oh teri!

Hell breaks loose.

Guys from their rooms stepping out in their underwear,
carrying their buckets.

Rooms are being knocked.
                                                         3.


Water is thrown on each other.

Those getting drenched taking off their clothes, picking up
their buckets and joining the dunk fight.

There is noise and chaos.

Lots and lots of students running around in their underwear
and splashing water on each other.

Soon there are lot of students participating in dunk fight.

Watchman watches and just shakes his head.

Sexa and Anni, completely drenched by now, watching the chaos
and enjoying.

                    SEXA
          Maza aa gaya, nahi?

Anni shakes his head in a no.

                    ANNI
          H3 jaate hain. Suna hai kutton pe
          jab paani padta hai toh unhe badi
          takleef hoti hai.

Sexa grins from ear to ear.

                    BOTH
          Juntaaaaaaa!!!

Everyone stops.

Anni gestures in one direction.

                    ANNI
          H3... attack.

Everyone raises their arms in excitement.

                                                           4.


                    ANNI
          (girl’s voice) Tumhaare hone waale
          bachche ki maa.

                    RAGGIE
          Iski ma ka...

Raggie opens the door angrily and suddenly goes quiet on
seeing so many H4 guys.

                    ANNI
          Akele doobega ya poore room ko
          saath mein leke doobega?

Raggie steps out, glaring the H4 guys.

                    RAGGIE
          Dekh Anni...

Anni gestures him to keep quiet.


EXT. HOSTEL 3 - GARDEN AREA - NIGHT

Raggie stands in the middle of the garden as Anni, Sexa and
all the H4 boys surround him.

                    ANNI
          Akad pakad kheech ke pakad.

                    CHORUS

                    CHORUS
          Haiyaa.

                                                         5.


Guys scream as they splash water on Raggie.

Just then 30 H3 guys run in and gather behind Raggie.

                    CHORUS
          Heyyyyyyyy!!!

Raggies wipes the water from his face and looks at Anni and
gang menacingly.

                    RAGGIE
          Saale losers.

                    ANNI
          Loser hoga tera baap.

Both sides move towards each other for a clash.

Aniruddh, middle aged now, wakes up.

He takes a deep breath, noise from his memories still echoing
in his head.

He looks out.

                    SERVANT
          Bahut late ho gaye aaj?

Servant takes Anni’s bag.

                    SERVANT (CONT’D)
          Khana laga dein?

                    ANNI

                    SERVANT

          hai.
                                                         6.


                    ANNI
          Kahan hai woh?

Servant points towards the room.

                    ANNI (CONT’D)
          Khaana laga do!

Mohit’s room.

                    MOHIT
          Tu sone de tab na!

                    RAGHAV
          Yaar ek doubt clear karna tha... I
          promise, last time!

                    MOHIT
          Yahi na ki iss saal ka entrance
          exam zyada tough tha ki last year
          ka, sabka maths achcha gaya ki sirf
          tera, sabko physics tough laga ki
          sirf tere ko, All India Rank ka
          final cut off kya hoga?

                    RAGHAV
          Sorry yaar thoda tension ho raha
          tha.

                    MOHIT
          Haan toh akele kyun tension lein.
          Sooraj ko bhi jagate hain na.

Sooraj’s room. He wakes up as his mobile rings. He looks at
it sleepily and picks up the call.

                    SOORAJ
          Haan Raghav...

                    RAGHAV
          So gaya kya?

                    SOORAJ
          Nahi, abhi abhi bubble bath le ke
          nikla hoon. Bol.

                    MOHIT
          (sarcastically) Dude, apne Raghav
          ko result ka tension ho raha hai
          Sooraj. Kuch kar na.
                                                         7.


                    SOORAJ
          Bhai maana ki hum tere 2 am friends
          hain par ab tu iska naajayaz faayda
          utha raha hai.

                    SOORAJ (CONT’D)
          Dekh teer chhoot chuka hai. Aur
          kuch dino mein pata chal jaayega ki
          kiska nishaane pe lag gaya hai
          ...aur kiski lag gayi hai. Abhi tu
          so ja aur sone de.

                    MOHIT
          Okay thank you ladies and
          gentlemen. It was nice talking to
          you. Jai mata dee, let’s rock.
          Goodnight, bye!

Raghav looks at the phone, takes a deep breath and cuts it.

Anni comes inside the room with food.

Raghav looks at him, as if caught.

Anni puts the food on a table next to Raghav’s bed and sits.

                    ANNI
          Beta jab tak achcha khana mil raha
          hai na, kha lena chahiye.

                    RAGHAV
          Sorry papa.

                    ANNI
          Sorry nahi, kuch din mein tere
          plate mein hostel ki mess ka khana
          aane wala hai. Jo halak ke andar
          kum, bahaar zyada aata hai.

Anni smiles.

Raghav understands the joke.

                    RAGHAV
          Wo khana bhi kha loonga papa bas
          mera selection ho jaaye.

                    ANNI
          Exams achche gaye hain... kyun nahi
          hoga. Tu kuch zyada hi tension le
          raha hai.

                    RAGHAV
          Aapko results ke pehle tension nahi
          hui thi kya?

Anni just smiles.
                                                           8.


                    RAGHAV (CONT’D)
          Aapko tension kaise hoti! Aap toh
          genius the na. All India Rank 384
          aayi thi na aapki! Main 2000 ke
          andar bhi aa jaaun na toh pagal ho
          jaaunga.

                    ANNI
          Arre yaar, do mahine tension mein
          nikaal diye toone. Iss se achcha
          girlfriend bana leta. Engineering
          college mein ladkiyon ki bahut
          shortage hoti hai.

                    RAGHAV
          Mummy toh aapko wahin mili thi.

                    ANNI
          Arre sabka naseeb mere jaisa
          kharaab nahi hota na.
              (passes the plate)
          Chal ab chup chaap khana kha.

Raghav starts eating. Anni is looking at the various elements
in the room.

His table is full of notes and NCT, JEE books. A snap of
Raghav with Maya.

His notice board reads expected marks against maths, physics
and chemistry papers.

A few motivational quotes etc.

                    RAGHAV
          Mera nahi hua toh?

                    ANNI
          Phir wahi baat. Confidence rakh.
          Zaroora hoga.


EXT. ROAD (2019) - DAY

A car is traveling.


INT. CAR (2019) - DAY

Aniruddh is sitting at the back seat with Raghav while
they’re driving to Maya’s house.

                    RAGHAV
          Aaj mummy ke ghar drop karne aap aa
          rahe ho? Itni meherbani kisliye?
                                                          9.


                    ANIRUDDH
          Soch raha hoon tere sath kuch time
          aur bita loon. Waise bhi kuch din
          mein tu hostel chala jaayega. Aur
          aaj ka din teri ma kha legi.

                    RAGHAV
          Aisa mat bolo yaar... mera bhi mann
          hota hai na unse milne ka.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Arre mujhe sab pata hai... tu sirf
          khaana dabaane jaata hai wahaan.

                       RAGHAV
          Kuch bhi.

                     ANIRUDDH
          Bahut dekhe maine tere jaise.
          Hostel mein do do milkshakes pe bik
          jaate the.

Raghav giggles.

                    RAGHAV
          Aapke paas better plan hai toh
          bolo, nahi jaaoonga.

                     ANIRUDDH
          Plan toh mere paas ek se badhkar ek
          rehte hain, tu toh jaanta hee hai.
          Par chala ja, bechaari wait kar
          rahi hogi.

                    RAGHAV
          Bechaari!!! Hain!!! Divorce ho gaya
          hai phir bhi kuch toh hai aap dono
          ke beech mein.

                    ANIRUDDH

Raghav giggles.

                    RAGHAV
          Chalo, hi toh bol do.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Main gareebon ki hi nahi leta.

Raghav turns to go away.

                      ANIRUDDH (CONT’D)
          Sunn...

Raghav looks back.

                    ANIRUDDH (CONT’D)
          Kuch achcha ho toh pack karwa lena.

Raghav smiles at him as he walks away towards the house.

Raghav is eating.

Maya is just looking at him.

                    RAGHAV

                      MAYA
          Haan toh?

                    RAGHAV
          Aapko kya lagta hai, mera hoga?

                    MAYA
          Mujhe lagta hai ki tera nahi bhi
          hua toh bhi koi problem nahi hai.

                    RAGHAV
          Papa ko lagta hai mera ho jaayega.

                    MAYA
          Ye Aniruddh bhi na... Papa ki
          baaton ka koi pressure lene ki
          zaroorat nahi hai.

                    RAGHAV
          Arre unhone ne koi pressure nahi
          daala...

                    MAYA
          Main usko bahut achchi tarah se
          jaanti hoon.
                                                        11.


                    RAGHAV
          Theek hai... phir toh aap ye bhi
          jaanti hongi ki papa ko bhindi

          Baap ka chamcha.

Raghav smiles.


INT. ANIRUDDH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM (2019) - NIGHT

Aniruddh enters the house. Servant comes and takes Anni’s bag
from his hand. Anni sees Raghav on his phone and comes and
sits next to him.

                    ANNI
          Champion! Kaisa hai?

Raghav shows him the bhindi he has got.

                    RAGHAV
          Ye aapke liye.

Anni takes out a nice bottle of whiskey with ribbons around
it.

                    ANNI
          Ye tere liye...

Raghav doesn’t get it.

                    ANNI (CONT’D)
          Tere result waale din hum dono
          saath mein celebrate karenge.

                    RAGHAV
          Kya papa, aap mera pressure badha
          rahe ho.

                    ANNI
          Arre iss se pressure badhta nahi,
          ghat jaata hai yaar.

Anni then looks a bit lost.

                    ANNI (CONT’D)
          Tu chala jaayega na toh mere paas
          sirf teri yaadein reh jaayengi.

Raghav looks at him and he looks emotional too.

Mohit presses enter.

He sees something on the screen and his smile disappears.

                        RAGHAV
             Kya hua?

Mohit just shakes his head in a no.

Raghav quickly takes the laptop and types his details and
presses enter.

The screen flashes “Better luck next time.”

He can’t believe it.

He feels dizzy as he tries to compose himself.

But fails.

He slumps on the chair, looking devastated.

                       MOHIT
             Papers toh achche gaye the yaar

          hue nahi dekha hai.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Maine usko bahut samjhaaya. Lekin
          wo sunne ko taiyyar hi nahi hai.

An upset Raghav is with Mohit at home. He is sobbing.

                    RAGHAV

          chhod ke 18-18 ghantey padhaai ki.

                    MAYA
          Tum har baat ko itna lightly kaise
          le sakte ho?

                    ANIRUDDH
          Tum har baat ko itna seriously kyon
          leti ho?

Back to Raghav.

                    RAGHAV
          Woh Sateesh, saala saal bhar mujhse
          peeche raha, aur uska ho gaya. Sab

          Tum kab tak aa rahe ho?

                    ANIRUDDH
          Ek important meeting hai. Khatam
          kar ke nikal raha hoon.

Back to Raghav. He is sitting on the edge of the balcony.
                                                        16.

          poori zindagi iss loser ke tag ke
          saath jeena padega.

                    MOHIT
          Yaar tu kuch zyada hi load le raha
          hai.

                    RAGHAV
          Nahin yaar! Sab khatam ho gaya. Sab
          khatam ho gaya.

Sitting on the edge of the balcony Raghav keeps looking at
Mohit with tears in his eyes and then suddenly he bends back
and disappears from Mohit’s sight.

Mohit is horrified.

                      MOHIT
          Raghav!!!

He doesn’t believe what he hears.

                    ANNI
          What? What happened to Raghav?

He slumps on his chair as if feeling dizzy.

One of his colleagues asks him.

                       COLLEAGUE
          You ok?

Aniruddh doesn’t know what to say, tears welling up in his

A worried Aniruddh walks through the hospital corridor.

He reaches outside the operation theatre to find Maya sitting
there. Mohit is standing nearby.

The operation is in progress.

Maya looks at Aniruddh and gives him a hurt look.

Aniruddh walks up to Mohit, composes himself before asking.

                       ANIRUDDH
          Kaise hua?

Mohit breaks down.

                    MOHIT
          Woh bahut upset tha uncle... bol
          raha tha sab usko loser
          bulaayenge...

Maya is crying.

                    MOHIT (CONT’D)
          And before I could react... he...
          jumped. I’m so sorry uncle, I’m so
          sorry!

Aniruddh tries hard to control his tears but fails.

He slowly walks and sits near Maya.

                    MAYA
          Galti meri hai. Kaash maine Raghav
          ki custody tumhe nahi dee hoti.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Tumhe lag raha hai ki ye sab jo hua
          meri wajah se hua hai.
                                                        18.


Maya tries to control her anger as she cries.

                    MAYA
          Woh bechaara bachcha itne pressure
          mein tha tumhe dikhaai nahi diya?
          He has tried to commit suicide.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Mujhe kya pata tha ki woh itna bada
          step utha lega?

                    MAYA
          Tumhe pata hee kya hai Anni, apni
          meetings aur apne kaam ke alaawa?
          Na tumne mujhe samajhne ki koshish
          ki, na apne bete ko.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Yahaan... yahaan shuru mat karo
          Maya, log dekh rahe hain.

Maya goes little louder.

                    MAYA
          Toh dekhne do... unhe bhi toh pata
          chale ki kitne irresponsible father
          ho tum. Tumhaare kaaran mera
          beta...

Aniruddh screams back in anger.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Stop it Maya... he is not dead.

People look at them as they struggle with their emotions.

Just then the operation theater door opens and son is brought
out on a stretcher.

He looks in bad shape.

Maya and Aniruddh get up and look at him as he is taken away,
with Maya inconsolable and Aniruddh trying hard to control
himself. Mohit is numb.

Doctor comes out of the operation theater and tells them.

                    DOCTOR

                    DOCTOR
          Main aapko jhooti tasalli nahi
          doonga. Aapke bete ko brain mein
          severe injury hui hai, multiple
          organs bhi damaged hain.
          Abhi surgery karke humne internal
          bleeding roki hai, brain se clots
          bhi nikaale hain. But that’s not
          all.

Maya and Anni are looking at him.

                    DOCTOR (CONT’D)
          Usse brain mein contusions bhi
          hain. Agar contusions badhte hain,
          toh brain mein swelling badh
          jaayegi, jiske liye ek aur surgery
          karni padh sakti hai. Filhaal usse
          ICU mein under observation rakhna
          padega and wait for him to
          stablize. He is extremely critical.

Maya and Aniruddh are speechless as they control their tears.

                    MAYA
          Bach toh jaayega na?

                    DOCTOR
          We are trying our best.

Doctor takes his time to respond.

                    ANNI
          Ek baar uss se mil sakte hain?

Doctor gives a reluctant nod.

                    ANIRUDDH
          This is not fair yaar Raghav. Mann

          Lekin aapke bete ka case uss se
          ulta hai. Looks like woh jeena hee

Aniruddh and Maya become more tense.

                    DOCTOR (CONT’D)
          It’s not a good sign.

          Aur ye tumse aur mujhse behtar koi
          nahi jaanta hai ki loser ka tag
          insaan pehanta bhi khud hai... aur
          utaarta bhi khud hai.

the pages.


INT. HOSTEL 3 - MESS (1992) - NIGHT

Raggie is sitting with some of his hostel mates who are
looking at the applications.

One of them reads out a bio-data.

                    H3 B
          Sundar Srivastava... All India Rank
          92.

                    RAGGIE
          Rank chhod, sports mein kuch hai?

                       H3 B
          Tch.

                       RAGGIE
          Dramatics?

                       H3 B
          Tch.
                                                          60.


                       RAGGIE
          Hata isko.

That guy picks up another form.

                    H3 B
          Aniruddh Pathak... All India
          Rank...

Raggie snaps.

                    RAGGIE
          Rank poochha tere ko?

That guy looks at Raggie apologetically and continues.

                    H3 B
          State level basketball player hai.

                       RAGGIE

                    H3 B
          Cricket aur football bhi khelta
          hai.

Raggie looks up.

                    RAGGIE
          Kis hostel se hai?

                       H3 B
          Losers.

Raggie smiles.

                    RAGGIE
          Bula isko, main khud miloonga iss
          se.



EXT. HOSTEL 3 - GARDEN AREA(1992) - DAY

Aniruddh is looking at H3 building which is swanky.

There are students playing volleyball with great zeal.

Raggie enters the frame and puts his hand on Aniruddh’s
shoulder.

                    RAGGIE
          Andar se aur bhi achcha hai.

Shakes hands with Anni.

          Raggie.
                                                           61.


EXT. HOSTEL 3 - CORRIDOR (1992) - DAY

Raggie and Aniruddh are walking in the corridor.

                    RAGGIE
          Tu soch raha hoga ki institute toh
          same hai phir sirf H3 itna
          chakachak kyon hai? Arre bhai world
          class institute hai. Yahaan foreign
          students bhi aate hain aur foreign
          delegates bhi. Ab agar unko H4
          jaise hostel mein thehraaya toh kya
          impression padega?

Raggie winks at Aniruddh.

Aniruddh is understanding.

                    RAGGIE (CONT’D)
          Chai piyega? Peene laayak banti hai
          yahan pe.


INT. HOSTEL 3 - MESS (1992) - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Raggie and Aniruddh are drinking tea.

Aniruddh is looking at the mess which is much better.

                    RAGGIE
          We are the face of this aur
          institute apna face toh chakachak
          rakhega na.
          Chal, kal bag leke aa jaa.


EXT. INSTITUTE - CAMPUS ROAD - DAY

Anni walks back, happily.


EXT. HOSTEL 4 - ENTRANCE/RECEPTION (1992) - DAY

Slow motion, soft music.

Aniruddh is entering the hostel.

He sees two guys running in undies with buckets in their
hands.


INT. HOSTEL 4 - MESS (1992) - DAY

Aniruddh is sitting in mess and seeing Acid and others
laughing at a joke Acid has cracked.

Aniruddh gets a faint smile on his face.
                                                        62.


EXT. HOSTEL 4 - WING CORRIDOR (1992) - EVENING

Sexa takes off a guys towel and runs. The guy tries to hide
his privates.

Aniruddh looks emotional.


EXT. GIRL’S HOSTEL - SITTING AREA (1992) - NIGHT

Aniruddh is sitting with Maya. He is lost in deep thought.

                       MAYA
             Tum na paagal ho. Kal tak toh tumhe
             H3 jaana tha, aaj kya ho gaya?

                        ANIRUDDH
             H4 chhodne ka maan hee nahi kar
             raha yaar.

                       MAYA
             Itna kya soch rahe ho? Do maheene
             hee toh bitaaye hai tumne H4 mein.

                       ANIRUDDH
             Tumhaare saath bhi do maheene hee
             bitaaye hain. Phir tumhaare saath
             apni problem kyon share kar raha
             hoon?

It makes Maya think.

                       ANIRUDDH (CONT’D)
             Ek bonding si ho gayi hai na yaar.

Maya nods.

                       ANIRUDDH (CONT’D)
             Pata hai Mummy ke ghar se laddoo
             sirf uske liye nahi, sabke liye
             aate hain. Acid jab bhi frustrate
             hota hai sab khushi khushi uski
             gaali kha lete hain. Aur Sexa jaisa
             bhi ho, raat ko teen baje bhi aawaz
             doge na toh darwaaze pe khada milta
             hai. Ab isko kya kahenge?

                       MAYA
             Family.

                       ANIRUDDH
             Exactly... aur family jaisi bhi ho
             usse chhoda toh nahi jaata.

Maya looks at Aniruddh emotionally.
                                                           63.


INT. HOSPITAL - ICU (2019) - AFTERNOON

Maya is telling Raghav. Aniruddh is just standing there.

                    MAYA
          Aur uss din mujhe pehli baar laga
          ki Anni ka dimaag jitna chaalu tha,
          dil utna hee saaf tha.


INT. HOSTEL 3 - MESS (1992) - NIGHT

Raggie has a stunned expression on his face.

Aniruddh is sitting in front of him.

                    RAGGIE
          Log marte hain H3 mein aane ke liye
          aur tu saamne se na bol raha hai.
          Itni aukaat kaise ho gayi teri,
          saale freshie.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Look I am really sorry but..

                    RAGGIE
          Sorry? Sorry tu khud ko bolega
          be... har saal... Derek ki tarah.
          Usne bhi yahi attitude dikhaaya
          tha. H3 aata toh winners ki tarah
          jeeta...ab saala 3 saal se sad raha
          hai na, losers ke tag ke saath. Ab
          tu bhi sadega. Dekh kya raha hai,
          chal nikal.

Aniruddh looks at the rest of H3 gang. One of them pats on
his shoulder.

                    H3 (B)
          Oh hero! Suna nahi? Nikal.

Anni gets up and give him glares.

Two guys push him.

                    H3 (A) (CONT’D)
          Kya dekh raha hai, nikal.

Anni is looking at them angrily.

INT. HOSPITAL - ICU CORRIDOR (2019) - AFTERNOON

Derek enters.

All the guys get up slowly, looking at him.

Derek is looking at them with a smile.

                    DEREK
          Saare losers ek saath, ek chhat ke
          neechhe?

                    SEXA
          Loser kisko bol raha hai be takle?

                    DEREK
          Apne baap ko takla bol raha hai
          saale.

Derek stands there smiling.

                     SEXA
          Derek!!!

Anni stands up upon hearing of Derek. Everyone is hugging
Derek. Derek and Anni exchange a look.


INT. HOSTEL 4 - MESS (1992) - NIGHT

Derek is looking at Aniruddh, who is sitting and eating. He
stands up as he looks at Derek.

                    DEREK
          Khaane ke baad daru peeta hai?

                    ANIRUDDH
          Saath mein aur pehle bhi pee leta
          hoon.
                                                        65.


Derek smiles.

Frame freezes.

Super: Derek

                    ANIRUDDH (V.O.)
          Ye Derek tha. Hostel ka sabse bada
          loser, aur hum sabka naajaayaz
          baap.


INT. INSTITUTE - CHEMISTRY LAB (1992) - NIGHT

Derek and Aniruddh are drinking.

Derek measures alcohol and other drinks with test tubes and
pours in beakers. He looks pleased with himself.

                    DEREK
          60 ml Vodka, 40 ml narangi aur 20
          ml soda.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Yeh kya hai sir?

                    DEREK
          Sabko naseeb nahi hota, Derek
          special.

He offers it to Aniruddh.

                    ANNI
          Par yahaan kyu?

                    DEREK
          Itni raat ko barf aur kahaan
          milegi?

                    DEREK (CONT’D)
          Ice udhar hai.

Aniruddh turns and looks at a container.

                    DEREK (CONT’D)
          Woh liquid nitrogen hai. Ice udhar
          hai.

Aniruddh takes out ice cubes carefully with a tong.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Ye ice hee hai na?

                    DEREK
          Edison ko bulb ke baare mein pooch
          raha hai.

Aniruddh smiles.
                                                        66.


They do cheers and start sipping.

Derek stylishly lights his cigarette with a matchbox.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Voh Raggie bol raha tha ki H3
          vaalon ne aapko bhi offer kiya tha.

                    DEREK
          Kutta hai saala Raggie. Voh doosre
          hostels ke achche players ko H3 le
          jaata hai. Aur phir GC jeetne ka
          credit khaata hai.

                       ANIRUDDH
          GC?

                    DEREK
          General Championship Sports.

                     ANIRUDDH
          Hamaare institute mein sports bhi
          hote hain?

                    DEREK
          Toh? Tujhe kya laga yahaan par sirf
          padhaai hoti hai?

Aniruddh is thinking.

                    DEREK (CONT’D)
          Aur tujhe kya laga hame losers
          isliye bulaate hain kyunki hamaare
          rooms chhote aur hamara mess bekaar
          hai?

                    ANIRUDDH
          Itni important hai GC?

                    DEREK
          Important? (chuckles) Important
          nahi hoti toh 10 hostel 2 maheene
          32 sports mein compete nahi karte.

Quick flashes of GC.

          Important nahi hoti toh doosre
          hostels ke liye pride aur hamaare
          liye har saal izzat ka sawaal nahi
          hoti.

More quick flashes of GC. Ends on crowd screaming ‘LOSERS’

                    ANIRUDDH
          Itna bura khelte hain hum?

Derek gives him a defeated smile.
                                                           67.


                    DEREK
          Khatam kar.


INT. INSTITUTE - MAIN BUILDING SCROLL BOARD AREA (1992)-
NIGHT

Derek and Anni are standing in front the scroll board.

The names of GC winners are mentioned on the board.

H3 features prominently on the list.

                     ANIRUDDH
          Pichchle 15 saal se mein hum ne ek
          baar bhi log ek baar bhi GC nahi
          jeeta hai?

                    DEREK
          Jeetna toh door ki baat hai. Hum
          log har saal last aate hain.

Aniruddh looks pensive.

                       DEREK (CONT’D)
          Ab samjha?

                    ANIRUDDH
          Samjha. Matlab agar hum GC jeet
          gaye toh ye loser ka tag hatt
          jaayega?

Derek looks at him and smiles sarcastically.

                    DEREK
          Sochna bhi mat. Teen saal try kar
          ke dekh liya...

                    ANIRUDDH
          Last saal hai aapka, ek last time
          aur try kar lo.

                    DEREK
          Chhod na yaar kuch nahi hone waala.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Kuch nahi karenge toh vaise bhi
          kuch nahi vala.

          Option:
          Try nahin karenge toh vaise bhi
          kuch nahi hone vala.

Derek smirks.
                                                           68.


                    DEREK
          Dekh, naya hai na tu isliye tere ko
          chubh raha hai... ek do saal ruk ke
          dekh, chubhna band ho jaayega.

Some other drunk students passing by pass comments.

                    STUDENT
          Sirf taadte hi rahoge ya kabhi
          aaoge bhi board pe...

                       CHORUS
          Ai losers.

                    DEREK
          Abbe loser hoga tera baap saale.
          Dum hai toh yahaan pe aake bol.

Students walk away laughing.

Derek is looking at them angrily.

He then turns to Aniruddh.

Aniruddh is looking at him meaningfully.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Maano na maano, chhubhta toh aapko
          aaj bhi hai.

Derek is just looking at him.


INT. HOSPITAL - ICU (2019) - AFTERNOON

Derek is telling Raghav.

                    DEREK
          Anni ki baat ko maine do din tak
          seriously socha.


EXT. HOSTEL 4 - DEREK’S ROOM/WING CORRIDOR (1992) - NIGHT

Derek is smoking outside his room, lost in thoughts.

                     DEREK (V.O.)
          Phir laga ki agar iss saal kuch
          nahi kiya toh ye baat poori zindagi
          chhubhegi.


Music picks up.


INT. HOSTEL 4 - MESS - EVENING

Derek finishes his cigarette and looks at the gathering.
                                                        69.


                    DEREK
          Tum mein se bahut se log aise ho
          jinko H4 chhod ke jaane ka mauka
          mila nahi. Ab tumhare paas do
          options hain. Ya toh hum iss loser
          ke tag ke saath jiyein. Ya isse
          hatane ki koshish karein. Agar tum
          mein se koi aisa hai jo iss loser
          ke tag ke saath khush hai toh wo
          yahaan se jaa sakta hai. Trust me,
          koi kuch nahi bolega.

30 odd students leave the mess. Derek looks in appreciation
that most of the students have stayed back.

                    DEREK (CONT’D)
          Ek baat main poore experience ke
          saath keh sakta hoon ki campus mein
          yeh loser ka tag sabse zyada
          chhubhta hai. Lekin uss se bhi
          zyada ek cheez chubhti hai iss tag
          ko hataane ki koshish hi na karna.

Everyone is listening.

Derek screams.

                    DEREK (CONT’D)
          Toh ab sawaal yeh uthta hai, kya
          hum le loser ka tag hataana chahte
          hain?

                    CHORUS
          Yesssssssss!!!

                    DEREK
          Kya hum ye loser ka tag hataa sakte
          hain?

                    CHORUS
          Yessssssss!!!

                    DEREK
          Kya hum iss saal GC jeet sakte
          hain?

Only Aniruddh’s hand goes up.

                    ANIRUDDH

                    SEXA (CONT’D)

          Saale Sexa!

And they both dive into the swimming pool.

They come out with a fainted freshie. Anni is pressing the
freshie’s stomach to remove the water.

          Bhai agar yeh mar gaya toh jail ho
          jaani hai hamko.

          Jab kaam ko time chahiye toh

          na. Toh ab agar family ko time
          chahiye toh kaam ko bhi understand
          karna padega. Main ruk raha hoon.

Derek looks at others.

                      SEXA
          Main bhi.

Others nod too.

Anni and Maya look touched.

                    MAYA
          Great! Kisi ko bhook lagi hai?

INT. HOSTEL 4 - MESS (1992) - NIGHT

Team H4 have gathered for a late night meeting.

Anni is standing in front of a board. He draws a graph.

          GC mein ab tak H3 ki murgi 2 gold,
          2 silver aur ek bronze leke 17
          points pe dance kar rahi hai.

He puts a magnetic sticker of a ‘murgi’ at the end of the

          Aur hamaara murga, hamesha ki
          tarah, zero pe ande de raha hai.

He put a magnetic sticker of a ‘murga’ of the zero point.

                    ANIRUDDH (CONT’D)
          Toh ab sawaal ye hai ki hamaara
          murga unki murgi ki lega kaise?
          Itna talent toh hamaare paas hai
          nahi.

                    SEXA
          Matlab hamaari tarah hamaara murga
          bhi virgin hee rahega?

                    ANIRUDDH
          Nahi. Agar hum log tikdam
          lagaayenge toh abhi bhi hum unki le
          sakte hain.

Aniruddh removes the paper that’s covering a board.

The board reads ‘Pressure Cooker’

                    ANIRUDDH
          Tikdam no.1: Pressure Cooker.

Everyone wonders.

                    ANIRUDDH (CONT’D)
          Saamne wali team pe itna pressure
          daalo ki unki seeti baj jaaye.

          Nahi jaayega.

The guy looks at Anni. He smirks and goes back to taking the
shot.

                    ANIRUDDH (CONT’D)
          Haath kaap raha hai iska... nervous

          Phat gayi iski... tu goti khel
          bhai... miss karega... ai... ai...

The guy plays a dead shot.

The striker doesn’t even reach the coin.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Toh bhai baat simple hai. Jab
          pressure aata hai toh banda hagta
          hai. Ab soch, agar ek banda itna
          pressure daal sakta hai toh
          pacchees - pachaas aise haraami kya
          karenge.

                    DEREK
          Saale, GC mein khelne ke liye dhang

Anni covers his nose.

                    ANNI

          Bohot accha kar raha hai.

They All cheer.
                                                       118.


INT. INSTITUTE - WEIGHT LIFTING ARENA (1992) - DAY

                    REFEREE

          Dulari Pitroda

Anni’s and others’ smile drops.

                    ANNI
          Ye googly kahaan se aa gayi be?

Maya turns. She has a smile on her face, cheering. Anni lets
out a sigh. Sexa rushes to Maya.

                    SEXA
          Bhai, kyu hamare pet pe laat maar
          rahi hai?

                    MAYA
          Mujhe kya pata tha tum log 42 kilo
          ka ladka le aaoge?

                    SEXA
          Withdraw kar le na?

                      MAYA
          Too late!

Sexa comes back to his seat.

                    SEXA
          Ab toh bhai jung ladni padegi.

                      DANDA
          Ab?

                    ANNI
          Ye teri zindagi ka woh mod hai,
          jahaan tujhe hostel ki ijjat ke
          liye nahi apni ijjat ke baare mein
          sochna hai. Ladki se haara na toh
          yeh jallat teri zindagi bhar tera
          danda karenge. Chahta hai aisa?
          Nahin na? Jaa, bacha le apne aap
          ko.

                    DANDA
          Jai sherawala maiyya ki!


What follows is a fierce battle between Danda and the other
girl as to who can make the lightest of the weights look the
heaviest. Amidst loud cheering from H4 gang.
                                                          119.


The girl goes and lifts what looks heavy by her standards.

A nervous looking Danda turns to Anni.

Anni is tensed that Dolly Pitroda might win.

Danda walks up to the weight and tries to lift it.

Anni and gang watch him do so nervously.

Danda manages to hold it for 3 seconds and Anni and gang
cheer him up loudly.

The girl comes forward. She is about to lift the weight and
Sexa starts to cheer.

                    SEXA
          Akkad Pakad...

                    DEREK
          Ladki hai...

                      SEXA
          Sorry ...

Sexa sits down sheepishly.

2-3 quick cuts of girl lifting the weights. Followed by
Danda.

Finally the girl fails to lift a weight.

Amidst anticipation and tension Danda walks up to the weight.

Anni and gang hold their breath.

Danda manages to lift the weight and looks at the clock on
the wall.

Those three seconds of holding the weight look like an
eternity as the seconds hand of the clock moves very slowly.
Anni and gang watch nervously. Danda’s hands shake, he is
sweating and legs start to shiver.

As Danda manages to pull it off he jumps and celebrates like
he has done something major.

Anni and gang rush and lift him up.

Music picks up.


INT. HOSTEL 4 - ENTRANCE (1992) - DAY

Celebrations are going on in H4.

Danda with a maala round his neck is the centre of

Aniruddh is dancing as Derek watches everyone with a smile.

                    ANIRUDDH (V.O.)
          Uss dinn Danda ke gold se hostel ki
          shaan wapas aa gayi hai.

          saare hostels ki dhadkane badh rahi
          thi.

Cut Aniruddh is putting H3 murgi ahead. Everyone is tensed.

                    ANIRUDDH (V.O.)
          Har saal ki tarah H3 sabse aage
          tha...

Aniruddh now takes H4 murga and places it not too far away
from H3 ki murgi. H4 gang heaves a sigh of relief.

                    ANIRUDDH (V.O.)
          ...lekin pehli baar H4 sabse peecha
          nahi tha.

Boys from H4 are looking at the GC tally board.

Anni takes H4 ka murga closer to H3 ki murgi.

                    ANNI
          H3 ki murgi, H3 ka murga..
                                                          121.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Chance toh hai.

Both smile.

                    DEREK
          Thanks man. Tu nahi hota toh...

                    ANIRUDDH

                     ANIRUDDH (V.O.)
          Aur GC khatam hone mein bas ek din
          baaki tha.

Bevda has a steel glass in his hand which he raises in toast.

                    SEXA
          Bhai, apne murgi ne murgi se toh
          badi nazdeekiyaan badha li.


                    BEVDA
          Cheers!

Derek takes a drag from his pen which he is holding as a
cigarette on his mouth.

                    DEREK
          Bevde, pani hi hai na?
                                                         124.


Bevda nods.

Mummy looks at his mother’s photo.

                    MUMMY
          Kal maa ki boli sunne milegi.

                    ACID
          Kal maa ki gaali bakne ko milegi.

Sexa is also getting excited.

                    SEXA
          Kal pehle playboy hoga phir boy ke
          saath play hoga.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Guys guys guys, C’mon! GC abhi tak
          khatam nahi hui hai. Kal last three
          finals hain. Aur teeno mein hamari
          H3 se takkar ke saath hai aur H3
          abhi bhi humse 5 points aagey hai.

We see the tally board. 4 x 400, Basketball and Chess.

                    ANIRUDDH (CONT’D)
          Agar hum teeno gold jeet gaye, toh
          hamara total score hota hai 75 aur
          H3 ka score hota hai 74. Matlab
          samajh rahe ho? Aur agar hum ek bhi
          match haar gaye toh hum GC haar
          jaayenge.

                    ANIRUDDH (CONT’D)
          Chess Bevda sambhal lega. Relay
          Derek aur Acid hai. Lekin yeh
          basketball ka kisi ne socha hai?

                    ACID
          Tu hain na.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Arre, nahin yaar, H3 ko basketball
          mein harana aasaan nahi hoga.

Stress is visible in the H4 camp.

                    ANIRUDDH (CONT’D)
          Anyway, we must rest now. Kal ka
          din bohot important hai. Ya?


INT. HOSPITAL - ICU (2019) - EVENING

Door opens. Nurse peeps in. Everyone looks at her.

She tells Aniruddh.
                                                          125.


                    NURSE
          Doctor ne bulaya hai.

It makes everyone think.


INT. HOSPITAL - DOCTOR'S CABIN (2019) - MOMENTS LATER

Ani and Maya are sitting opposite the doctor.

Doctor has already updated them about Raghav’s surgery.

Ani and Maya look scared.

                    DOCTOR
          Raghav ke brain mein swelling aur
          badh gayi hai. Abhi voh stable hai
          toh hum kal subah tak aur wait
          karenge. If there is no
          improvement, hamein kal subah
          surgery karni padegi.

Anni and Maya look nervous.

                    DOCTOR (CONT’D)
          Aur koi option nahi hai.

Ani and Maya exchange a look.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Theek hai sir.

                    DOCTOR
          Aap yeh consent form sign kar
          dijiye.

Doctor forwards the consent form.

                    ANIRUDDH
          Consent form?

                    DOCTOR
          Agar operation ke dauraan patient
          ko kuch ho gaya toh...

                    ANIRUDDH
          I understand sir.

Ani takes the pen to sign. He fumbles. He looks at Maya. She
gives him confidence by putting her hand on his shoulder.

Ani signs the form.


INT. HOSPITAL - ICU (2019) - EVENING - MOMENTS LATER

Aniruddh is already present in the room and informed them
that they have to leave now.
                                                       126.


                        ANNI
             Beta abhi hamein jaana padega.
             Baaki kal.

                       RAGHAV
             Papa, bas end hi toh bacha hai.

                       ANIRUDDH
             Nahi beta doctor ne kaha that you
             need to rest.

Sexa and Derek sense the tension on Ani’s face.

Derek says to lighten the mood.

                       DEREK
             Chhote na hum kahin bhaage jaa rahe
             hain na tu.

Sexa adds.

                       SEXA
             Bhai wo raat humne bhi suspense
             mein nikali thi, tu bhi thoda
             suspense mein nikaal.

Raghav smiles.


INT. ANIRUDDH’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM (2019)- NIGHT

H4 gang is sitting, Anni is looking worried, lost in his
thoughts.

                       ACID
             Don’t worry yaar. Kal sab theek ho
             jaayega.

                       ANIRUDDH
             Pata nahi yaar... par yeh baat
             yahan tak aani nahi chahiye thi...
             Aur yeh sab meri wajah se hua
             hai...

                       MUMMY
             Don’t be so hard on yourself.

                       DEREK
             Tu toh bahut cool dad hai.

                       ANIRUDDH
             Cool hoon na main! Wo bottle dekh
             raha hai.

Everyone looks in the direction. The whiskey bottle with
ribbon around it is kept on a table.
                                                        127.


                    ANIRUDDH (CONT’D)
          Raghav ko bola tha jis din uska
          selection hoga na uss din dono
          saath baith ke piyengey. Lekin yeh
          toh bataya hi nahi, ki nahi hua toh
          kya karengey! Aur yeh galti hum sab
          kar rahe hain. Bachche ki success
          ke baad kya karna hai yeh sabne
          soch rakha hai lekin failure ke
          saath kaise deal karna hai yeh kisi
          ne nahi socha. Beta achche marks
          laaogey toh woh college milega. Uss
          college jaaogey toh wahan job
          milega. 10 lakh bachche engineering
          ka entrance dete hain lekin select
          hote hain sirf 10 hazar. 9 lakh 90
          hazar ko pata hi nahi ki kya karna
          hai! Kyonki uski taiyaari toh
          unhone kee hee nahi thi. Unhe lagta
          hai ki wo exam mein nahi life mein
          fail ho gaye hain. Honestly agar
          aaj tu poochey ki mujhe Raghav ke
          liye college mein seat chahiye ya
          wo sahi salamat hopsital se aa
          jaaye toh mujhe bas yehi chahiye ki
          mera bachcha wapas aa jaaye. Aur
          kuch nahi chahiye yaar.

Close-up shot of everyone’s face. They all look emotional.
But Mummy has gotten a little teary eyed.

                       MUMMY
          Excuse me!

He takes his phone and moves aside.

Others also get up.

Mummy calls his son.

                    MUMMY (CONT’D)
          Chhotu hai?...
              (reply from other side)
          Usko phone dena.

                    MUMMY (CONT’D)
          Beta... aapko mera promise yaad
          hai? ... haan wahi ki maths mein A+
          laaogey toh bike dilaaunga... I
          just want to tell you ki agar tum
          B+, C-... tum jo bhi grade laao...
          main phir bhi tumhe wo bike
          dilaaunga...
              (something is said from
               other side)

                                                       145.


                    ANIRUDDH (CONT’D)
          Ab operation ke liye jaao, par
          loser ki tarah nahi, fighter ki
          tarah jaao.

Raghav nods.


INT. HOSPITAL - OT CORRIDOR/OT(2019) - MORNING

The stretcher is being dragged through the corridor leading
to the operation theater.

The old gang gestures him “All the best”

From Raghav’s POV he sees the youngsters wishing him luck.

A smile appears on his face.

The stretcher goes inside the OT.

Doors close. Camera is slowly charging towards closed door.

                    RAGHAV (V.O.)
          Pichchle kuch dino mein ek
          important baat seekhi hai maine.
          Hum haar jeet success failure mein
          itna ulajh gaye hain ki zindagi
          jeena bhool gaye hain. Zindagi mein
          agar kuch sabse zyada important
          hai, toh woh hai khud zindagi.


EXT. SOME CAMPUS (2020) - DAY

Raghav is leaning out of car window and feeling the wind in
the air.

                    RAGHAV (V.O.)
          Agle saal main college ja raha tha.
          Mat poochiye all India rank kya
          thi, department kya tha. Main khush
          tha ki main college ja raha tha.
          Naye dost banaane, apni zindagi
          jeene.

Wide shot of the car going on a campus road.

Raghav looks amused.

                    SENIOR (CONT’D)
          Hilaata hai?

He smiles as he turns back.

Old H4 gang is standing there, smiling.
